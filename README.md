I am currently based in Athens, Greece (GMT+02:00) and looking for a remote role as a software engineer. I am more than happy to travel and open to staying abroad short term when required. I currently consider relocating first and foremost to London, UK but open to Berlin, Germany or Switzerland for the right team.

I can also help you establish and run an engineering team in Athens. I have also been responsible for hiring and have experience in training developers, establishing processes and managing software delivery.

I am also available for short term contracting to advise and work alongside your team as we introduce continuous development and delivery within your organisation.

I am solely responsible for inventing, designing and developing [Windmill](https://qnoid.com/software-engineer/#windmill) from scratch. It has taken at least 12 months of full time work.

Prior to shifting my focus on becoming an Apple Developer, I was a Java EE developer. I started writing Java EE back in 2001 while working at CERN for my student placement year.

I have given a few talks. Here are some notable ones.

* NSConference, ‚Äú[Sound Debugging](https://qnoid.com/2013/06/08/Sound-Debugging.html#main)‚Äù, 18 March 2014, Leicester, UK.

* iOS Conf, ‚Äú[Memory and CPU Profiling](https://youtu.be/lyNHJOsAxIs)‚Äù, 8 March 2017, Athens, Greece.

* Athens iOS Meetups, ‚Äú[iOS Release Pipeline](https://youtu.be/1Vbn7vd7EWY)‚Äù, 12 June 2018, Athens, Greece.
