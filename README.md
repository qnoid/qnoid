I have 10 years of experience as an Apple Developer and 10 years as a Java Enteprise Developer. I have been developing software professionally since 2001 when I was offered a role at CERN as part of their Technical Student Programme. I proceeded to become a Java Enterprise Developer and got to grips with servers, *nix systems, databases, services and the JVM.

In 2009, on the dawn of the App Store, I took the plunge in becoming an iPhone developer. I attended the Stanford CS 193P course on iPhone Application Development. Four years later, in 2013, I released verylargebox on the App Store.A retail app that enabled local shops to have an online presence and reach out to customers on their iPhone.That same year I asked developers to reconsider the use of passwords. I gave that talk at NSConf right after Evan Doll, the man who taught the iPhone course at Stanford.The next year I returned to showcase how using sound patterns can help visualise code execution on an unfamiliar codebase and identify defects.

In 2018, I announced Windmill, a continuous delivery platform spanning across 3 platforms (iOS, macOS, Backend), 2 languages (Java, Swift).Windmill was the culmination of all the experience I have accumulated as a software engineer over the years. It took an enormous amount of effort, research and development to bring it to life. Paying great attention to the user experience while taking care of security and privacy.
